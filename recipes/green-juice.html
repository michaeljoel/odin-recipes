    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This green juice recipe is great for detoxing after the holidays or
      whenever you have overdone it! It's worth buying organic celery, even if
      you buy conventional for everything else. Adjust fruit and veggie amounts
      to suit your personal taste. More apples equals a sweeter drink.
